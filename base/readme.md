# Base project

Here is a base project to add new examples to the seed. Here's a few things you can do:
 - Make a new manifest. The webpack build will go ahead and replace ${OF_VER} and ${BASE_URL} in `openfin.config.json` with the url being served from and the runtime version for the build specifically.
 - Make a new page. Edit index.html src/main.ts is your entry point.
 - edit this readme. Explain what you are showcasing

For local edits the contents of local/ (except the readme) are gitignored.
