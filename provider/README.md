# Custom provider

This folder demonstrates using a custom provider.

The manifest found here (duplicated in `current-app-seed`) uses the custom window found in `platform-window` and sets the `platform.providerUrl` to this `index.html`.

The code (entry point `src/main.ts`) showcases how to override a platform provider.
